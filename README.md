# Fun with Python

A set of trivial programs I wrote in Python for fun and learning. I will keep adding more programs as I write them and they will gradually become more complex.

### [gameoflife](./gameoflife/)

Conway's game of life implemented in Python.

### [tictactoe](./tictactoe/)

A simple text-based tic-tac-toe game implemented in Python. The game can be played by two players or against the computer agent that is trained using a reinforcement algorithm. Includes the code for training the agent.

### [maze](./maze/)

Some trivial Python code that generates a random map, and then recursively calculates the sizes of each "room" in the map.
