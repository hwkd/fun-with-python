# Conway's Game of Life

## 🎲 Rules
For a space that is populated:
- Each cell with **one or no neighbours** dies ☠️, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with **four or more neighbours** dies ☠️, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with **two or three neighbours** survives 🎉.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
- Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated 🎉.
